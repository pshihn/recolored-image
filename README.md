# recolored-image

Custom element to show image shifted to a different color. 

Sometimes you want to show an image, usually a logo in different colors. If you had the logo in SVG, then you could easily change the colors using CSS. But what if the image is a png or a jpeg?

`recolored-image` is a custom-element to show an image color shifted to a target color.
